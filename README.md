I created this **modern responsive website** as a part of an online course created and designed by **Jonas Schmedtmann**.

This web page uses **flexbox**, **custom CSS properties**, **CSS variables**, **custom cubic-bezier transition** and **other** cool **animations and effects**.

The main purpose of this website is to show how easy and useful flexbox is.<br>
The entire website is designed around the flexbox properties.
